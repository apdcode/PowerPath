# ***COURSE CONTENT***

# 1. Introduction to Microsoft Power Platform

## [Unit 4/8 - Data Connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/introduction-power-platform/3-data-connectors)

**Tabular data** - Returns data in a structured table format. Power Apps can directly read and display these tables through galleries, forms, and other controls. Additionally, if the data source supports it, Power Apps can create, edit, and delete data from these data sources. Examples include Microsoft Dataverse, SharePoint, and SQL Server.

**Function-based data** - Uses functions to interact with the data source. These functions can be used to return a table of data but offer more extensive action such as the ability to send an email, update permissions, or create a calendar event. Examples include Office 365 Users, Project Online, and Azure Blob Storage.

**Connectors** - The bridges from your data source to your app, workflow, or dashboard. Microsoft Power Platform has more than 600 connectors available to common data sources. Connectors are divided into standard and premium. Some popular standard connectors are SharePoint, Outlook, and YouTube. Premium connectors require additional licensing for your app and/or users. A few premium connectors are SQL Server, Survey Monkey, and Mail Chimp.

**Creating Custom Connectors** - You can create custom connectors using 3 different approaches:

    Using a blank custom connector
    From an OpenAPI definition
    From a Postman collection

## [Unit 5/8 Data loss prevention, compliance, privacy, and accessibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/introduction-power-platform/3a-data-loss-prevention-compliance-privacy-accessibility)

**Data loss prevention policies** - Connectors can be classified as either Business or Non-Business in the context of your organization. Connectors that host business-use data should be classified as Business and connectors that host personal-use data should be classified as Non-Business. Any connectors that you want to restrict usage of across one or more environments should be classified as Blocked. When a new policy is created, all connectors are defaulted to the Non-Business group. From there they can be moved to Business or Blocked based on your preference. You can manage connectors when you create or modify the properties of a DLP policy from the [Microsoft Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). These affect Microsoft Power Platform canvas apps and Power Automate flows. To create a DLP policy, you need to be a tenant admin or have the Environment Admin role.

**Data Protection** - All public endpoints are secured using industry-standard TLS

# 2. Introduction to Data Verse

[Unit 1/9 - Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/1-introduction)

In this module, you will:

    Explain what environments, tables, columns, and relationships are in Microsoft Dataverse
    Describe the difference between Microsoft Dataverse and Common Data Model
    Explain use cases and limitations of business rules and process flows

## [Unit 2/9 - Overview of Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/2-overview)

***A brief explanation of each category of features.***

**1. Security:** Aauthentication with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to allow for conditional access and multi-factor authentication. It supports authorization down to the row and column level and provides rich auditing capabilities.

**2. Logic:** Dataverse allows you to easily apply business logic at the data level. 

**3. Data:** Dataverse offers you the control to shape your data, allowing you to discover, model, validate, and report on your data. 

**4. Storage:** Physical data storage in Azure cloud. 

**5. Integration:** Dataverse connects in different ways to support your business needs. APIs, webhooks, eventing, and data exports give you flexibility to get data in and out.

**Common Data Model vs. Microsoft Dataverse -**
The standard table design in a Microsoft Dataverse database is based upon an open data model standard called Common Data Model; a logical design that includes a set of open-sourced, standardized, extensible data tables and relationships that Microsoft and its partners have published in an industry-wide initiative called the Open Data Initiative. This collection of predefined tables, columns, semantic metadata, and relationships form the basis of the Common Data Model ***=> there is practically no limit to how far you can extend a Microsoft Dataverse database.***

## [Unit 3/9 - Identify tables and columns in Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/3-identify-entities-fields)

***Three types of tables are:***

**Standard -** also known as out-of-box tables: Account, business unit, contact, task, and user tables. Most can be customized. Tables that are imported as part of a managed solution and set as customizable also appear as standard tables. Any user with appropriate privileges can customize these tables where the table property has customizable set to true.

**Managed -** Tables that arenâ€™t customizable and have been imported into the environment as part of a managed solution.

**Custom -** Custom tables are unmanaged tables that are either imported from an unmanaged solution or are new tables created directly in the Dataverse environment. Any user with appropriate privileges can fully customize these tables.

Every database in Microsoft Dataverse starts with a standard set of tables and each standard table has a standard set of columns.

## [Unit 4/9 - Understand relationships](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/4-understand-relationships)

A column that only allows unique values, such as invoice number, is used to identify the parent row. This unique column is called a key. The same value (the parent key) is stored in the related child rows. This column is called a foreign key when the child row is used to store the parent key value. Filtering is used to display child rows with a value in the foreign key that matches the key value in the parent row. This allows applications to display the child rows (line items in the previous example) that belong to a particular parent row (invoice in the previous example). This concept underlies many business software applications.

## [Unit 5/9 - Environments in Dataverse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/5-environments)

Environments are used to store, manage, and share your organization's business data, apps, and flows in Microsoft Power Platform. Each environment allows you to provision one Microsoft Dataverse database for use within that environment. Microsoft Dataverse environments allow you to manage user access, security settings, and the storage that is associated with that database.

Each environment is created under a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant, and its resources can only be accessed by users within that tenant. An environment is also bound to a geographic location, like the United States. When you create a Microsoft Dataverse database in an environment, that database is created within datacenters in that geographic location. Any items that you create in that environment (including connections, gateways, flows that are using Power Automate, and more) are also bound to their environment's location.

## [Unit 6/9 - Business rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-common-data-service/6-business-rules)

=> allow you to apply business logic at the data layer instead of at the app layer. 

The following business rule actions can be used by canvas and model-driven apps:

    Set column values
    Clear column values
    Validate data and show error messages

Model-driven apps can also use business rules to:

    Show or hide columns (model-driven apps only)
    Enable or disable columns (model-driven apps only)
    Create business recommendations based on business intelligence (model-driven apps only)

# [How to build an automated solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/)

### [Unit 1/7 - Intro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/1-introduction)

### [Unit 2/7 - Create a flow from a template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/2-create-flow-template)

For Templates, go to [Power Automate and search for template](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/) and select `Templates` from the left-hand menu => This description is outdated.

**`New Top Resource`** => [make.powerautomate.com, had to register with apdcode@xryk4.onmicrosoft.com](https://make.powerautomate.com/galleries/public/templates/65ceb79430ef4956a0855fbe09249cdf/save-office-365-email-attachments-to-onedrive-for-business?fromflowportal=true&environment=c9528a9c-30c1-ead1-9d99-f3413533305d)



[Unit 3/7 - Build recurring flows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/2a-build-recurring-flows)

[**`Launch Power Automate`**](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/c9528a9c-30c1-ead1-9d99-f3413533305d/home?fromflowportal=true)

**ERROR** Under [Create the flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/2a-build-recurring-flows) you're asked to:

    2. In the left pane, select + Create.
    3. Select Scheduled cloud flow under Start from blank.

=> `Start from blank` does not exist, but `Build your own` does, with `Start from blank...`  as part of a subtext.
However, the next step doesn't exist either:

![where is the dialog box](https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3hvL.png)

clicking `Build your own` will reveal a `Scheduled` option. But is it scheduled *cloud* flow? The user interfaces on `Power Automote` differs signifiantly from the tutorial as well:

![is this a scheduled cloud flow](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhKyz.png)

**This unit was a complete disaster. NOTHING made sense between the tutorial and the app**

### [Unit 4/7 - Build a button flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/2b-build-button-flow)

Skipped this section since the prvevious section was a complete mess. Needed a mobile app as well.

### [Unit 5/7 - Build an approval request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-automated-solution/2b-build-button-flow)

Needed SharePoint and twitter. SKIPPED!
